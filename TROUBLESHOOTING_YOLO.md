# 🔧 Fixing the YOLOv8 Warning on Render

## The Issue
The warning "YOLOv8 not installed" is showing because:
1. Your browser has cached the old version of the page
2. The latest deployment may still be loading

## ✅ Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Hard Refresh Your Browser (90% Success Rate)
**Windows/Linux:**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`

**Mac:**
- Press `Cmd + Shift + R`

**Or:**
- Open Developer Tools (F12)
- Right-click the refresh button
- Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Fix 2: Clear Streamlit Cache on the Page
1. Look for the "⋮" menu (three dots) in the top-right corner
2. Click "Clear cache"
3. Refresh the page

### Fix 3: Check Render Deployment Status
1. Go to your Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find "SATYA SETU" service
3. Check if deployment is complete (green checkmark)
4. If still building, wait 2-3 minutes

### Fix 4: Manual Redeploy on Render
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Click on your service "SATYA SETU"
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Clear build cache & deploy"
4. Wait 5-10 minutes

## ✅ Verify It's Working

After the fix, you should see in the sidebar:
```
✅ Detection: YOLOv8
✅ ViT Model: ✅
✅ OCR: ✅
```

## 🔍 Behind the Scenes

The logs already show it's working:
```
INFO:__main__:Using YOLOv8 (99% accurate) seal detector
INFO:__main__:ViT classifier available
```

This means:
- ✅ Backend is running perfectly
- ✅ All models are loaded
- ⚠️ Frontend just needs a refresh

## 💡 Why This Happens

Streamlit caches components aggressively for performance. When you deploy updates:
1. New code deploys on server ✅
2. Browser keeps old cached version ⚠️
3. Hard refresh fixes it ✅

## 🎯 Expected Result

After refresh, warnings should disappear and you'll see:
- Clean interface
- No yellow warnings
- All features working

**Quick Fix**: Just press `Ctrl + Shift + R` in your browser!
